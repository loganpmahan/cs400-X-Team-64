# X-Team 64 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We can either have our team leader assign tasks, or we can work together to 
determine appropriate tasks for each group member so the workload is spread out.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will break up the tasks and set deadlines and check ins to make sure we are
on pace to completing assignments on time.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will reach out to others in the group, addressing the difficulties
we have, and collaborate to determine best way to resolve the issue.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will comunicate with the members of our group before deadlines are due
to make sure that all memebers of the group are approaching a point that 
will ensure the task's completion before the deadline.
